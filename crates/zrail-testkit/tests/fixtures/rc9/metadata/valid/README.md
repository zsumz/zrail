`kafka-driver` owns the work between generated [`kafka-wire`](https://github.com/kafkars/kafka-wire)
messages and Kafka brokers: DNS, SASL, API negotiation, correlation, metadata
and coordinator routing, deadlines, reconnect policy, and semantic connection
lanes. Bornera owns the selector, connections, socket and TLS transports, and
bounded I/O beneath those policies. The driver has no async-runtime dependency
and is not a high-level producer or consumer client.

## Model

Policy and I/O have one explicit boundary:

```text
application       generated requests, routes, deadlines, Call<Response>
      │
kafka-driver      bounded admission, completion, embedded or dedicated host
      ├── core     State + Input -> Transition<State, Effect>
      ├── transport
      │            sans-I/O frame decoding and ordered write progress
      ├── reactor  DNS, SASL, timers, topology, and effect interpretation
      └── Bornera  selector, connection lifecycle, socket/TLS I/O, and limits
      │
Kafka brokers
```

Machines own Kafka policy and receive driver-relative time. The reactor reports
external outcomes as events. One connection is FIFO: a response must match the
pending queue front, and a mismatch closes that connection epoch. Machine state
has one owner and does not use locks.

Every mailbox, wait queue, frame, write buffer, in-flight request, timer, and
reactor turn is bounded. A `Call<T>` can block with `wait()` or be awaited as a
`Future`; both observe the same runtime-neutral completion cell.

## Use

Start a dedicated driver host and issue a generated `ApiVersions` request:

```rust
use std::{net::SocketAddr, time::Duration};

use kafka_driver::Driver;
use kafka_wire::ApiVersionsRequest;

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let broker: SocketAddr = "127.0.0.1:9092".parse()?;
    let (driver, host) = Driver::builder()
        .broker(broker)
        .client_id("example")
        .spawn()?;

    let _response = driver
        .call(ApiVersionsRequest::default(), Duration::from_secs(5))?
        .wait()??;

    driver.shutdown()?.wait()?;
    host.join()?;
    Ok(())
}
```

`spawn()` owns one dedicated reactor thread. `build_reactor()` returns the same
driver with a caller-driven `Reactor` for embedding in another event loop. The
embedded reactor is thread-affine: construct and drive it on its owner thread. No
public executor abstraction is required.

Direct numeric targets configured with `broker()` or `rustls_broker()` retain
one Bornera selector and reconnect the same configured address through fresh
connection generations after bounded backoff. Permanent authentication failure
and requested shutdown remain terminal. These direct targets do not refresh DNS
or discover and route a multi-broker topology; bootstrap targets retain that
broader ownership.

## Routes

Requests name Kafka semantics instead of sockets:

| Route | Destination |
| --- | --- |
| `AnyBroker` | The available seed connection. |
| `Controller` | The controller from current metadata. |
| `Broker` | One exact broker ID. |
| `Coordinator` | The coordinator for a group, transaction, or share key. |
| `PartitionLeader` | The current leader for one topic partition. |

Control, interactive, bulk, and long-poll traffic use separate semantic lanes
so a long-held Fetch does not head-of-line-block control work. Timeouts cover
the complete path from mailbox admission through routing, connection work,
write progress, and response completion.

## Crates

| Crate | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `kafka-driver` | Public request API, cluster routing, completion, reactor hosting, TLS, and SASL. |
| `kafka-driver-core` | Deterministic connection, broker, metadata, coordinator, authentication, and bootstrap machines. |
| `kafka-driver-transport` | Sans-I/O frame decoding and bounded FIFO write progress. |

`kafka-wire` remains the protocol authority for API keys, versions, messages,
headers, and codecs. The driver does not duplicate that vocabulary.

## Proof

The canonical repository gate runs formatting, Clippy with and without default
features, the complete workspace test suite, rustdoc with warnings denied, and
immutable-diff checks:

```sh
scripts/check
```

The test surface includes pure machine scenarios with virtual time,
fixed-seed frame fuzzing, loopback transport and TLS integration, bounded
concurrency and shutdown tests, and separate real-broker qualification against
Kafka 4.3.1. CI runs the same canonical gate on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

The locked graph resolves the audited `kafka-wire` and Bornera releases from
the public registry; no sibling checkout is required:

```sh
cargo fetch --locked
scripts/check
```

## Status

`kafka-driver` 0.1.0-rc.5 is the fifth release candidate. This source consumes
`kafka-wire` 0.1.0-rc.3 and the Bornera 0.0.1-rc.3 family from the public
registry. Public APIs may still change before 0.1.0.

Opt-in route-failure rejection also covers unsent requests queued before a
connection failure was observed. Default requests continue waiting for recovery;
neither policy restarts the caller's deadline.

Coordinator discovery also repairs missing broker-directory metadata through
the existing bounded refresh owner. A locally unavailable route still settles
without fabricating observed-response evidence; retries keep their original
deadline.
